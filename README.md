CubeEngine is a rendering engine written in C++, developed as a personal hobby project and for portfolio purposes. This engine utilizes an integrated renderer based on both OpenGL and Vulkan. The primary objective of this project is to implement features learned from college courses, particularly those focused on OpenGL graphics. Furthermore, the project aims to adapt and apply these OpenGL-based techniques to Vulkan, thereby gaining proficiency in both graphics APIs.

## Minimum Requirements
1. Latest Graphics Driver
2. GPU with Vulkan version 1.3 or above supported
3. Discrete GPU recommended
 
## How to Build
Currently it only supports MSVC compiler(Visual Studio 2022 Recommended).
1. Open CMD at a root directory.
2. Input "mkdir build" -> "cd build" -> "cmake .."

All required APIs and Libraries are integrated in Project.

## Features
1. Running on OpenGL & Vulkan Graphics APIs.
2. Batch Rendering
3. [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) Integrated
4. SoundManager with ImGui UI
5. Basic 2D Game Engine Features
6. 3D Plane, Cube Meshes

## Future Plans
1. Linux Support
2. Basic 3D Mesh Lighting
3. C++ Code Optimization

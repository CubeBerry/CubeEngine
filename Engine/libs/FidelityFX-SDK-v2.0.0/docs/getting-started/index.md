<h1>Introduction to the AMD FidelityFX SDK</h1>

The FidelityFX SDK is a collection of heavily optimized effects (headers and DLLs) that can be used by developers to improve their DirectXÂ®12 applications. The FidelityFX SDK includes:

- [Super Resolution 2.3.4 Upscaler](../techniques/super-resolution-temporal.md)
- [Super Resolution 3.1.5 Upscaler](../techniques/super-resolution-upscaler.md)
- [Super Resolution 4.0.2 Upscaler](../techniques/super-resolution-ml.md)

<h2>Supported ecosystems</h2>

This version of the AMD FidelityFX SDK comes with samples that run on the following APIs:

- DirectX(R)12

The shader code used by our sample framework is written in HLSL, and can easily be ported to other platforms which support modern shader models.

If you are a registered Xbox developer, you can find AMD FidelityFX features available as part of the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK).

<h2>Samples</h2>

All samples are written in C++, and use the [FidelityFX Cauldron Framework](../../Kits/Cauldron2/dx12/) sample framework.

<h2>Open source</h2>

AMD FidelityFX SDK is open source, and distributed under the MIT license.

For more information on the license terms please refer to the [license](license.md).

<h2>Support</h2>

We endeavour to keep the AMD FidelityFX SDK updated with new features and bug fixes as often as we can, and perform compatibility and performance testing on a wide range of hardware.

If you find an issue, or have a request for the SDK, please consider opening an issue.
